## Problem Description

The idea is to build a single page application using our API which contains a list of top events on the page, essentially a vastly simplified version of this page this [https://smarkets.com/sport/football](https://smarkets.com/sport/football)
Clicking on an event name, it should go to a different page to display basic information about that event. (example: name, league, start time)
